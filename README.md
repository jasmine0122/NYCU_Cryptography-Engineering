## Critique 1
Paper: Juels and R. Rivest. "Honeywords: Making password-cracking detectable." In ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security, 2013

## Critique 2
Reading for Critique 2: Whitten, Alma, and J. Doug Tygar. “Why Johnny Can’t Encrypt: A Usability Evaluation of PGP 5.0.” USENIX Security Symposium. Vol. 348. 1999.

## Quiz 1
Output contents: the numbers of letters’ appearance in the ciphertext

## Quiz 2
1. Please determine the dimension of the rectangle for this encryption cipher.
2. Please Solve this following transposition cipher which involves a completely filled rectangles from the
HINT.
3. Please count Index of Coincidence (IC) for each messages.
The IC of English is around 0.
4. Given the following ciphertext, please determine if this encrypted message was enciphered using a
monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic cipher based on the message’s index of coincidence.

## Quiz 3
1. Please write a python program to determine keyword length of the
encrypted message using I.C.
2. Then write a second python program to solve the encryption
keyword letters for the message.
3. Finally, break these ciphertext and recover to the plaintext.
